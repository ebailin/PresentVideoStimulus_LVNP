# PresentVideoStimulus_LVNP
This repo contains the "app" to display video clips at extremely consistent rates. It is the skeleton for all video stimulus presented at the Laboratory for Visual Neuroplasticity.

##Background
This app was the third attempt by the LVNP to present video footage at a consistent frame rate. It was written because we found that despite video clips being exactly the same length, frame rate, and approximate memory size, they would play at widely differing rates. As these clips were the stimulus for functional magentic resounance imaging, fluctuations of more than a few microseconds could render the final analysis completely moot. 

###Specifications:
  1) Video presentation with no more than .10 seconds of timing fluctations **Critical**
